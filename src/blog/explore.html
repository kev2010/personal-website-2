            <h3 class="section-title">üåä &nbsp; A Complex World</h3>
            <hr class="line">
            <p>
                After my first year in college, I made a feeble attempt to write daily journals, documenting my goals and problems as I tried to fight through my misery. I felt like I was so bad at everything that I was passionate about. I didn‚Äôt know what direction to take career-wise, why I had such low self-confidence, and why I was projecting onto others.
            </p>
            <p>
                But as I reflect on those journals now, I realized that I wasn't writing for that present me, or even for that past me looking back. I was writing for the distant future me, the one I hoped would one day stumble upon my words and understand the pain and confusion I was feeling. I wish I had been able to offer some practical advice to my younger self, someone who was struggling to find their direction and overcome their self-doubt.
            </p>
            <p>
                In today‚Äôs complex world, where modern education focuses on subjects like math, science, arts, and history, it‚Äôs honestly baffling to me <b>how little structure</b> there is on the most important topic of all: how to navigate life. Seriously - why the heck are we learning about differential equations, reading about Shakespeare, or chanting that the mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell if we don‚Äôt even know how to discover what we actually love? Why are we blindly following others‚Äô definitions of ‚Äúcool‚Äù or ‚Äúawesome‚Äù if buried deep, deep down, our hearts are whispering that it‚Äôs not actually what we want? 
            </p>
            <p>
                I know I'm not the only one who has struggled with these questions, and I know I'm not the only one who has hit "life blocks" (e.g. a fork in careers, a sudden loss of motivation, how to make friends) and didn't know what to do or how to think about it. That's why I want to offer my own two cents, not as a mentor or guru, but as a friend who has been there. This is for those of you who want to increase your happiness, no matter what your ambition or risk-tolerance is. I write from the perspective of someone who has struggled, but who has also found ways to overcome those struggles and move forward. I hope my words can help you do the same.
            </p>

                For any decision you come across, it's highly likely that you're not exploring nearly enough and aggressively as you should be. The sad truth is that most of us don't realize how badly we're failing at exploration. If we could see a version of ourselves that had been exploring as much as we should, we would immediately see the vast difference (i.e. loss aversion).
            </p>
            <p>
                People always say to explore more, but the crucial problem is that <b>the correct level of exploration isn't obvious</b> - whether it's figuring out what field we enjoy studying, what kind of friends we like to be around, what career to take, or how to solve a relationship problem. It's my goal to provide a more accurate framing of this issue.
            </p>
            <p>
                Think about it this way: there are more possible positions in chess than atoms in the universe. There are more possible positions in Go than atoms in the universe. And yet, our lives are even more complex than these games. If you don't believe me, then either you've exhausted all the possible decision paths you could've tried, or you lack imagination. Sadly, the latter is probably true.
            </p>
            <p>
                To give you an analogy, some of you might be familiar with the multi-armed bandit problem. For those who don‚Äôt know what that is, a ‚Äúsingle-armed bandit‚Äù is just a slot machine. If you pull on the lever, you will earn an unknown reward with an unknown probability. The multi-armed bandit problem is when you have many single-armed bandits with varying unknown rewards and unknown probabilities. In other words, a bunch of slot machines where you have no clue what the rewards are for each of them and how often they each come out. What should your strategy be to maximize the reward you can get?
            </p>
            <figure>
                <img src="../imgs/slot-machines.png" alt="missing" style="max-width: 500px"/>
                <figcaption>A visual representation of the multi-arm bandit problem! How do you pull on the levers when you don't know what the rewards and probabilities are?</figcaption>
            </figure>
            <p>
                This boils down to a problem of <i>exploration</i> (how much time is dedicated to trying different slot machines) vs. <i>exploitation</i> (how much time is dedicated to using the one slot machine that seems to give the best reward right now). In reality, life looks more like an infinite number of slot machines, each offering an infinite number of rewards depending on how you pull the lever. In other words, the number of possible actions you can take is so absurdly high that, even with 8 billion people in the world, you can be unique really easily. 
            </p>
            <p>
                With such a large number of slot machines and ways to pull on the machines, you would intuitively expect that the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù strategy would include 1.5 metric shit-tons of exploring - after all, you have an infinite number of slot machines! Do you still really think you‚Äôre even remotely close to what you should be doing? If you do, then you probably lack imagination.
            </p>
            <p>
                It‚Äôs not your fault that you have such a heavy bias toward exploitation. Specialization and following the status quo are woven so deeply into the fabric of modern reality that we don‚Äôt even realize it. 
            </p>

                We‚Äôre expected to pick one field to major in and do a job related to it before you‚Äôre 20. We‚Äôre expected to work at just one company for a long time to ‚Äúclimb the ladder‚Äù. We‚Äôre expected to learn an instrument and stick with it for many years. We‚Äôre expected to solve math equations in one specific way or else we get a bad grade. We‚Äôre expected to pick one sport in the beginning. We‚Äôre expected to learn about school subjects in a really specific, arbitrary way that is uninspiring. We‚Äôre expected to go through middle and high school in a one-size-fits-all manner. Wow - so much for having an infinite number of slot machines!
            </p>

                Life, which is supposed to be beautifully creative, full of vibrant colors and emotions, imbued with curious paradoxes and mind-boggling mysteries, and an ever-changing dance between the border of order and chaos, has been unfairly reduced to a constant hum of mindless digging, black and white thinking, and lack of appreciation for the infinite potential that lies within us.
            </p>
            <p>
                We have to embrace the full potential of our minds. We must strive to explore new ideas and try new things. This means taking risks, making mistakes, and facing challenges head-on. It means breaking out of the mold and embracing the unknown. It means embracing the beauty of life and all its complexities. It means striving to be the best versions of ourselves, not just for our own sake, but for the sake of those around us. 
            </p>
            <p>
                When was the last time you explored a completely orthogonal topic, just for the sake of curiosity? When was the last time you tried something new, just to see what would happen? When was the last time you took a risk, just to see where it would take you? If you can't remember, then it's time to start exploring. Because the rewards of exploration are so much greater than the risks. And the world is waiting for you to discover them.
            </p>
            <p>
                A lot of my messaging so far has been specifically for seemingly ‚Äúgrand‚Äù life choices. <b>But this same exploration philosophy applies for any decision or problem you have - however big or small.</b> If you‚Äôre in a negotiation, explore creative options (e.g. swap teams to put them into each others‚Äô shoes to solve people problems, look for ways to combine forces rather than remain competitors, look at differences as an opportunity to create value). If you‚Äôre having a problem dealing with a friend of yours, don‚Äôt get trapped into one mindset - explore creative options (e.g. bring in a mutually trusted third person, completely change the environment to induce more friendly discussions, write a personal, handwritten note instead of texting). If you‚Äôre trying to learn a new subject, explore a variety of options (e.g. watch YouTube, cold email a bunch of experts and see if they are willing to help you, actually fly to a different country to learn a new language). You get the point. When you are unsure of what to do in literally any scenario, <b>ask yourself what other options you can explore </b>- the more creative, the better! I do this all the time when I'm stuck.
            </p>

            <h3 class="section-title">üçÉ &nbsp; Dynamic</h3>
            <hr class="line">
            <p>
                One thing to be aware of is that the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù amount of exploration is <b>not a static value</b>. It is a dynamic one. In poker, there is a concept of game theory optimal, or GTO, which is the absolute best strategy a player can play. Poker is a complex game, and we don‚Äôt know what the GTO strategy looks like exactly (we have some approximations with solvers and AI). In poker tournaments, the GTO is actually dynamic because the variables of the game constantly change minute to minute: the blinds, the chip stack sizes, the players you sit with, etc. The best tournament poker players are very exploitative and able to quickly adapt with the constantly shifting dynamics of the game. Cash games, which are more common in your typical frat and casino, have a more static GTO strategy since the variables are more fixed.
            </p>
            <p>
                In general, your ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù amount of exploring decreases with more ‚Äúfixed‚Äù responsibilities. When you have kids, for example, you can‚Äôt simply ignore raising them. This is why younger people can take on more risk (e.g. launch a startup). Other examples of fixed responsibilities could be religious duties, a full-time job, relationships, etc. <i>If you‚Äôve found something truly special, something that ‚Äúcalls‚Äù to you, you will naturally spend less time exploring ‚Äî don‚Äôt lie to yourself though!</i> But something like classes are not fixed responsibilities, especially if you find them boring. It‚Äôs ok to spend less time, get by with a ‚Äúworse‚Äù grade, and spend all the other time on things you value more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because your life variables are changing so often, it‚Äôs hard to evaluate what the right amount of exploring is. Is it trying to learn one or two new topics this week? Is it five or six? Unfortunately, I believe there is no better answer than to just play around! You‚Äôll have to be brutally honest with yourself. Do you actually think that trying one more class or testing out one more activity is past your exploratory limit? Or is it because of your inherent bias towards inaction or fear of other‚Äôs judgement? Another way to find out is to err on the side of exploring too much. You won‚Äôt know your limit until you reach it!
            </p>
            <br>
            <h3 class="section-title">üé≤ &nbsp; Average</h3>
            <hr class="line">
            <p>
                Most exploring will end up with you realizing that you don‚Äôt like the ‚Äúthing‚Äù. But that‚Äôs not a sign of failure like what most people would think. If you look at the median or mode result, exploration looks like a scam. Why bother exploring if most of the time you‚Äôll find out you didn‚Äôt like something?
            </p>
            <p>
                But people fail to account for two things. First, the results of exploration have high variance. Imagine if I rolled a six-sided die where you lose $1 on numbers 1-5 and won $1000 on a 6. You would obviously want to play this game even though the median and mode result is a loss of $1. That‚Äôs because the average result is that you earn about $166 dollars per roll. This sounds extreme, but that‚Äôs exactly like the payout for exploration. Most of the time, you‚Äôll lose a little bit of time (1 day? 1 week? 1 month?), but sometimes you‚Äôll discover something amazing that you‚Äôll devote a lot of time to (1 year? 3 years? 5-10 years?). The order of magnitudes is completely different. So looking at the average result makes it much more clear why exploration is so crucial and taking an absurd number of shots matters a lot. Bump the number of shots that you think you should take in the next year by at least an order of magnitude, and you‚Äôll be closer to what you should be at.
            </p>
            <p>
                Second, the ‚Äúpayouts‚Äù are not as clearly defined as ‚Äúlosing $1‚Äù or ‚Äúwinning $1000‚Äù. They also aren‚Äôt necessarily monetary. Sometimes you‚Äôll learn that you hated an activity/subject, but learned an interesting key principle or two from it. Does that mean you ‚Äúlost‚Äù? Even though you learned something cool? A lot of us are quick to assume that we know the value of something, not accounting for the fact that life has a lot of uncertainty in it. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I‚Äôm even willing to go as far as to say that if you‚Äôre exploring ‚Äúcorrectly‚Äù (i.e. maximizing for learning rather than results: for soccer, learning under good coaches rather than doing pointless drills by yourself or for math, taking high value, inspirational classes rather than studying old textbooks that drill memorization into your head), then you‚Äôre never going to get a negative value dice roll. Everything will be positive value. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The younger you are, the more you should maximize for learning and increasing your ‚Äúpotential‚Äù. Explore stuff where you think by the end of the day, you‚Äôll learn a lot from it even if you end up not liking it. While this might sound obvious, you are probably lying to yourself about which things will actually increase your potential. The amount of bias that‚Äôs inherent in us, whether that‚Äôs our peer‚Äôs judgement of us, parental influence, or lure of money, severely clouds our judgement. It‚Äôs part of the reason why you see so many of the most brilliant students in the world funnel themselves into niche jobs where you‚Äôll make a boat load of money, even if it doesn‚Äôt make anyone‚Äôs lives better except the pockets of the elite and themselves (there are, of course, exceptions to this, but they are rarer). There are so many things out there that many are ignoring. The world is so much more infinite than the current tunnel vision a majority of society has.

                The power of exploration is best illustrated through the stories of those who have embraced it. My peers, for instance, have provided me with a range of inspiring examples that showcase the benefits of exploration. But remember that it is paramount to also understand that you‚Äôll never fully grasp or learn what I say unless you <b>put it into practice and do.</b>
            </p>

                One of my friends, who I have the utmost admiration and respect for, took a gap semester and summer to put his life and health on the line to help victims caught in the crossfire of Israel's apartheid. He traveled to this conflict zone and dedicated himself to fighting for change, empowering others with education, and giving the unfortunate the most valuable currency of all: hope. In fact, a literal bombing occurred just 10 minutes from where he was living. This is a stark contrast to the majority of us who attend MIT, living in the comfort of our bubble and often oblivious to the full range of the world. My friend's bravery and selflessness truly inspires me, and serves as a reminder of the power of exploration and the willingness to take risks for a greater cause.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of my friends was not satisfied with his college studies, feeling as though he had no control over his own life and was constantly being pressured by his parents and peers to follow the "standard route". However, two years into college, he decided to take a leap and drop out to pursue something that truly intrigued him: poker. He had already become quite skilled at the game and wanted to continue improving, despite the fact that this decision went against the expectations of those around him. As a result, he had some incredible experiences, from playing in underground poker games in NYC to playing on streams with top professionals. This is a powerful example of exploring one's passions and taking risks, even when it goes against the norm. 
            </p>
            <p>
                I took a gap semester my senior spring to pursue a startup. My family, coming from a very traditional Asian background, thoroughly did not enjoy my decision. The journey was wild and unpredictable, filled with challenges and obstacles. I raised $1.4M, was accepted into Y Combinator, and even hosted Lil Nas X's birthday party at the Hype House. But along with these exciting experiences came a plethora of cofounder issues, extreme uncertainty, and confusion. I realized there is an incomprehensible difference between hearing someone say something is hard, and actually realizing that it‚Äôs hard. Despite my startup ending in shambles, I learned invaluable lessons and am now 10x more prepared for my next venture. 
            </p>
            <p>
                These examples of jumping all-in into something you believe in, even if it‚Äôs contrary to what others think is good, is definitely on the more extreme end of the spectrum. But even if you don't have a high appetite for risk, there are still countless ways to explore. It simply means that certain high-risk endeavors may not be a good fit for you, but there are infinite possibilities for lower risk exploration that can yield high rewards. And remember, the probabilities and rewards of each potential passion will vary from person to person. This is the beauty of exploration - the opportunity to discover what truly excites and motivates you, on your own terms.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you‚Äôre a college student who tends to be more social, join several different clubs (key word is different). Heck, maybe a join a dancing group, a business club, a board games club, and a rocket team. You probably went through high school with a small group of friends, which is good. But in college, you have more range to explore, so why not try out many different groups? You‚Äôll learn more and can usually leave early if you realize you didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Even as an upperclassman, it's never too late to join new groups and discover new passions. I personally joined a startup community during my senior year, and I'm proud to call them some of my closest friends in action. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As a college student, you should also take more exploratory classes outside of your major. Typically, students take a lot of classes in their degree with either zero or one exploratory classes per semester. Why not try two or three? If you‚Äôre a computer science major, why not try to take something in biotech, quantum physics, and architecture? I explored a variety of classes during college: negotiation, education, startups, making (3D printing, CNC machining, molding & casting, machine design), law, and finance. You can even take this a step further and pursue internships in completely different fields during the summer. Why follow the crowd when you can explore new and exciting opportunities that are orthogonal to your major?
            </p>
            <p>
                Even if you have already graduated and have a full-time job, you can still explore new passions and interests. One of my friends was unsure of what she wanted to do with her life, despite having had many interesting internships and experiences. She decided to take a lower-risk route and accept a "normal" job while exploring a wide range of topics in her free time. This allowed her to discover new interests and passions without risking her financial stability or career progress.
            </p>
            <p>
                Even as a high school student, you can still make the most of your limited freedom and explore new interests and passions. Take advantage of your free time outside of school to try new sports, topics, and communities. You usually can‚Äôt take that many different classes than your peers other than honors/AP versions. So you‚Äôll have to take the burden onto yourself to explore in your free time and hold yourself accountable for seeking out new experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you think that the examples above are only for the "ambitious" and that you can't relate, you are simply lacking in imagination. Even as a farmer, there are countless ways to explore new interests and passions that can bring happiness and fulfillment. Try different sports with your community, play various board games with your family, read books, or experiment with exotic cooking recipes. No matter how ambitious or risk-tolerant you are, there is always something to explore and discover. It's all about finding what excites and motivates you, and taking the time and effort to pursue it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Take a moment to consider everything you're currently doing in your life, and think about what new interests and activities you've always wanted to try. The beauty of living in this day and age is that there are endless opportunities available to us, thanks to the internet and the wealth of knowledge we already possess. It's easy to dismiss these opportunities because of our fear of the unknown, but taking small steps can make a big difference. Set aside just 10 minutes a day to try something new. Then 20 minutes. Then 30 minutes. Before you know it, you'll be dedicating 10 hours a week to exploring your passions. No matter who you are or what background you have, there are a million things you could explore - you just have to start now. Explore, explore, explore! If you‚Äôre sitting there and reading this, thinking to yourself that you‚Äôre exploring enough with one new thing a week, you‚Äôre in the completely wrong order or magnitude.

                What I‚Äôm writing here might seem like a bit much. Perhaps you‚Äôre someone already exploring a lot, and you just thought of 5 or 10 new cool things to try. Perhaps you‚Äôre someone who struggles to try new things due to your environment, or you just got exposed to this for the first time. Whatever the case, you don‚Äôt have to be harsh on yourself and feel like you have to reach the ‚Äúoptimal‚Äù amount of exploring.

                To give a poker analogy, you don't need to be the perfect player to win. In fact, the goal is simply to make fewer mistakes than your opponent. As long as you're constantly improving and fixing your "leaks" - the actions that cost you money - you're on the right track. Similarly, you don‚Äôt have to reach the optimal amount of exploring overnight. If you read this whole article and make a small change in your mindset and take action to explore a little bit more, then that‚Äôs a success. Not only will you be happier, but others will benefit from it too. The more you refine your own thinking, combine what I say with your beliefs, and actually take action, the more you'll be able to surprise yourself with what you're capable of.

                As a former prisoner of my own comfort zone, I know the fear and uncertainty that comes with venturing into the unknown. I blindly followed what my parents told me to study, what my environment told me was important, and what society told me would make me happy. I had a small, homogenous group of friends that formed an echo chamber (i.e. ‚Äúif everyone thinks alike, then no one is thinking‚Äù). But college thrusted me into a completely new environment. Though I still struggle with the pull of the familiar, I have learned to embrace the thrill of the unknown and revel in the abundance of new experiences.

                If a nobody like me can make a lot of change in just a few years, so can you. Cut the bullshit and just try a bunch of stuff. You don‚Äôt need to go around and spend months talking to people about what to do. Just start now. I gave you many examples already, so just take the time to actually try 10 to 20 new things this month.

                If you improve yourself by 1% every week, you‚Äôll be 1.7x yourself by the end of the year and 2.8x by the end of two years. If you improve yourself by 2% every week, you‚Äôll be 2.8x yourself by the end of the year and 7.8x by the end of two years. Change it to 3% a week, and you get 4.7x and 21.6x, respectively. Crazy, right?
