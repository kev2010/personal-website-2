            <p>Hi! I love building products, design, and the art of negotiation.</p>
            <p>I did CS at MIT and two startups: an <a href="https://simulationlabs.ai/" target="_blank">AI simulation platform</a> (1M+ messages sent, 4k+ MAU) and an NFT marketplace for creators (YC S22, raised $1.4M, hosted celebrity events at the LA Hype House).</p>
            <p>I've advised/worked at AI startups and researched at Harvard Business School and MIT Brain & Cognitive Sciences. I was a 4x <a href="https://www.teamusa.com/profiles/kevin-jiang" target="_blank">US Taekwondo National Team Member</a> and won global events. I also love poker â€” I taught poker theory at MIT Sloan and was the MIT Poker Club co-president!</p>

                I'm 22 and just graduated MIT with a CS degree. I'm currently working on an <a href="https://negotiate.vercel.app/">negotiation AI</a>. I previously raised $1.4 million for an NFT marketplace for creators startup. My cofounder and I were accepted into YC S22 cohort and hosted Lil Nas X's birthday party at the LA Hype House where we lived. We built, from scratch, a creator network of >1 billion collective followers. Here are some other cool stuff I've done:

                    I did Taekwondo for 16 years. I was lucky enough to be on the US National Team 4x, leading the US teams that won gold at the 2017 and 2020 Pan-American International Taekwondo Championships and bronze at the 2019 Taekwondo World Cup. Although my <a href="https://www.teamusa.org/usa-taekwondo/athletes/Kevin-Jiang">TeamUSA page</a> is a bit outdated, it is still cool!

                    Check out my work in <a href="https://fab.cba.mit.edu/classes/MAS.863/Architecture/people/Kevin/index.html">MIT's grad class, How To Make Almost Anything,</a> at the MIT Media Lab, where I learned to laser cut, use CAD, 3D scan and print, use CNC machines, mold and cast, design, solder, and program PCB boards from scratch, and more!

                    I was an instructor at the MIT Sloan School of Management, teaching poker theory to 171 undergraduate, graduate, and MBA students in 2020 and 2021. I mainly play mid-stakes online sit-and-gos and tournaments, but I've also played at various casinos and underground games in NYC. I was the co-president of the MIT Poker Club for almost two years, where I helped organize events for 500+ club members with the $70k+ funding we receive every year from our quant sponsors.
